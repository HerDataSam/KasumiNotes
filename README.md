# KasumiNotes

시즈루 노트의 한국 서버 버전입니다.

## Requirement
* Android 8+  
> If you are located in Chinese mainland, it is highly recommend you to set KasumiNotes and system download manager to go through your proxy software since there are some **INTERESTING** reasons that you may get holy terrible connection speed to Github while ShizuruNotes try to connect Github to fetch update information every time it is launched.

## Build
Builded on Android Studio 3.6 RC 3.  
Gradle building configuration could be found in `./app/build.gradle` and it might be changed time to time.
